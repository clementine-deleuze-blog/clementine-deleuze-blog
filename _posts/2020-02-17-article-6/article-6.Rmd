| General topic?               | The main subject of the artcle is the changing fish populations in Narragansett Bay due to the warming of the ocean. More specificly scientists are trying to undertand which species pose the greatest threat |

| Procedure/what was examined? | Reaserchers are working on what's happening to the fish populations in Narragansett Bay by using a qualitative “network” model that provides data on species populations and water temperature. The ideal would be a quantitative model (Quantitative models calculate the population numbers of different organisms and measure the rates of change) but if the numbers don't exist, the best you can do is a qualitative model. This qualitative model can be based on the striped sea robin's diets for example.They also studied how the diet of black see bass and cod overlaps, they analyzed stomach contents of the fish as well as samples of muscle and liver. Small ear bones called otoliths are also collected because, like tree rings, they show a fish’s yearly growth as well as environmental conditions. Reaserchers can also use isotopes, which provide chemical fingerprints of the organism's diet.|

| Conclusions/discovery?       | Many new fish species are now found in Rhode Island waters. In Narragansett Bay, one of the most significant changes in recent years has been an increase in the population of the striped sea robin, a fish that wasn’t found in Rhode Island waters in the 1960s and '70s, but has spread northward as ocean temperatures have risen. It's also the case for black sea bass which are originally from the mid Atlantic bight region and are now moving northward as waters have warmed. For a local species, the cod, both warming waters and resources competition with new species are a threat for their survival. Indeed, cod prefers cold water and are now in competition with black sea bass for ressources. Also, the overlap between the larval stages of some commercially important fish (like winter flounder, summer flounder, black sea bass, etc) and the striped sea robins (not economically important) predation period is causing a decrease in the population of the valuable species. |
