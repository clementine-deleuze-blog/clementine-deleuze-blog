# experienced its warmest month on record.
Over all, the past six years have been the warmest ever recorded in the region. (arctic)

# Arctic sea ice  continued to decline this year, matching the second lowest summer extent recorded since satellite records began in 1979.
# the Bering Sea, site of some of the largest commercial fisheries in the United States, saw unprecedented reductions in sea ice for the second winter in a ro

#the warming Arctic was shrinking their access to the food resources
70 Indigenous communities in Alaska including the Inupiat, Central Yupik, Cupik, St. Lawrence Island Yupik and Unangan peoples. 
# used to be harvested in the fall are now ready in summer.
#Permafrost sequesters twice as much heat-trapping carbon dioxide as is currently in the atmosphere. As that ground thaws it releases that carbon into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.  thawing permafrost will lead to still more thawing permafrost, Alaskan permafrost have found that more carbon is being released than stored.
 will make climate change worse.
