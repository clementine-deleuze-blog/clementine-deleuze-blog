| Researchers                  |  Reserchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Donald K. Perovich, a professor of engineering at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmout College and the lead author of the report’s chapter on sea ice. Mellisa Johnson, a guest editor on the report and a member of the Bering Sea Elders Group. Matthew Druckenmiller, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder and one of the report’s editors. |

| General topic?               | Temperatures in the Arctic region are still near record highs and it increased the thawing of the sea ice. It also has cascading impacts on fisheries and ecosystems, and it grows concerns over sea level rise. | 
| Procedure/what was examined? | Records of the past years were examined since 1979 (where satellite records began).It also include input from some of the communities that are directly affected by the melting of the ice and the warming of the ocean. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The past six years have been the warmest ever recorded in the Arctic. And the decline of the arctic ice was shrinking the access to the food resources of the different communities living in this area. It also has consequences on the harvest which used to be in the fall but which is ready in summer know. It also lead to the thawing of the permafrost, which releases the carbon dioxide it contained directly into the atmosphere, exacerbing climate change. |
| Remaining questions?         | The question is whether the measurements in Alaska over a several year period are representative of the broader Arctic system of other regions in the Arctic where permafrost exists |
