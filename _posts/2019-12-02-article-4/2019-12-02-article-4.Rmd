| General topic?               | It's an international study about ocean warming, it suggests that some cold water species will continue to thrive by seeking refuge in cooler, deeper water. | 
| Procedure/what was examined? | Three million records of thousands of species from 200 ecological communities across the globe (between 1985 and 2014) were analysed. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The study suggests that warm water species tend to increase and cold water marine species tend to become less successfull as the global temperature increase. However the study also shows how some of the cold water species adapt.
| Remaining questions?         | What is the maximum temperature tolerance for the marine species ? |
